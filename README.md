## ❌ Why Existing Tools Don’t Work

We’ve tested every major phone/email OSINT tool—and they all fell short. Here’s what we found lacking:

- 💸 **Unfair Monthly Subscriptions**  
  Why pay $10–$20 monthly for a few searches when you rarely need them?

- 💰 **High Pricing, Low Value**  
  Premium prices for average results? No thanks.

- 🧩 **One-Size-Fits-None Solutions**  
  Different use cases need different tools. Period.

- 💤 **Zero Innovation**  
  Too many tools are copy-paste clones with no vision.

- 🔐 **Privacy Concerns**  
  Some platforms may log your searches—dangerous and unethical.

- 🧱 **Terrible UI/UX**  
  A product from the 90s in 2025? That’s just bad design.

- 🛑 **Unannounced Price Hikes**  
  Sudden price changes = user betrayal.

## ✅ How Profiler Solves These Problems

- **🚫 No Subscriptions** – Only pay when you use something.
- **💵 Affordable & Transparent Pricing** – Lowest industry rates. Credits never expire.
- **🛠 Multiple Tools for Multiple Use Cases** – Basic to advanced level investigation.
- **🆕 Regular Updates & Tool Additions** – Profiler is a long-term product, not a side project.
- **🤝 Transparent & Community-Driven** – Built by the OSINT community, for the community.
- **🎨 Clean, User-Friendly UI/UX** – Built with usability in mind.
- **📢 Fair Pricing Always** – No surprise hikes. Ever.
